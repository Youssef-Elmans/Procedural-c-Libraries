C++ Reusable Class Libraries
This repository contains a set of reusable C++ libraries developed with clean, maintainable code.
Each library serves a specific purpose and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

1. clsInputValidation
Purpose:
A helper library for validating user input.
Provides functions to read and validate integers, floats, doubles, characters, strings, ensuring that all input meets the required format and constraints.

2. clsString
Purpose:
An advanced string-processing library.
Includes functions for trimming whitespace, changing letter case, reversing text, splitting and joining strings, counting and replacing words, removing punctuation, and checking for palindromes.

3. clsUtil
Purpose:
A general utility library offering miscellaneous helper functions.
Features include random number generation, random password creation,File Manipulation Functions,and basic screen-control operations.

4. clsDate
Purpose:
A comprehensive date-handling library.
Offers functions to create, compare, format, and validate dates, perform date arithmetic (add/subtract days), and calculate differences between dates.


5. clsPeriod
Purpose:
A period-management library built on top of clsDate.

Represents a time period defined by a start date and an end date.
Provides functions to calculate the period length in days, check if two periods overlap, determine whether a specific date falls within a period, and count the number of overlapping days between two periods.

Designed to simplify working with date ranges while applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
